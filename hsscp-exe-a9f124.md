Generally considered safe when obtained from official sources, hsscp.exe may, however, trigger false positive alerts from certain antivirus programs due to its nature as a networking tool. Users may encounter various errors related to this executable, such as issues with starting the Hotspot Shield application or connectivity problems, which can often be resolved by reinstalling the software or updating to the latest version. Despite its legitimate purpose, users should remain cautious and ensure that they download the application from trusted websites to avoid potential security risks associated with counterfeit versions that may harbor malware.
